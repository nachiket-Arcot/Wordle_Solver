Have you always struggled in finding the word in the daily wordle game ? Using a wordlist this program can help you find the word in the NYT wordle game. You just have to input the letters that are in the correct position, in the word but not in the correct position and letters that aren't in the word and the program will narrow down possible words. I did use this program to solve actual wordle games and so far it has been succesful. As of now this program is command line based but I am currently working on making it a GUI basically a Visual Interface.
