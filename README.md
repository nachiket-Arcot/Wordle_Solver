Have you ever struggled to find the right word in the daily NYT Wordle game? This program uses a wordlist to help you narrow down possible words and find the correct answer. Simply input:

-Letters in the correct position
-Letters in the word but in the wrong position
-Letters not in the word
The program will filter potential solutions based on your input. I have successfully used it to solve actual Wordle games.
Currently, the program runs on the command line, but I am working on developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience. There are still some issues to fix, but improvements are underway!
